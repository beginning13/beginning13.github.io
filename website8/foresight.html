    <h2>Foresight</h2>
    <p class="first-par">We cannot predict the future, but we can learn about and influence it.</p>
    <p>Answers about future are not easier than questions. <span class="highlight-italic">We cannot continue driving by looking at the rear-view window.</span> (M. Willenius) Futures thinking requires different minds than we were taught to develop. Harmonizing the changing outer and inner environments and concentrating on the most important thing is probably the best recipe for success.</p>
    <p>Knowledge about possible, plausible and preferable futures helps take better decisions now. But is there any reliable way to know the future? The answer is yes and no. Knowledge about futures can be as reliable or unreliable as knowledge in any other field or about any other subject. Quality of knowledge depends both on the tools and on the hands that hold the tools. For great results, science and art shall go together.</p>

    <h3>If we need help with our long-term choices, why invite Lauras Nareiko?</h3>
    <p class="first-par">Being a <span class="highlight-cherry-thin">professional futurist</span>, I can help you anticipate how future may unfold and how to influence it. I have worked with cases of extreme uncertainty and complexity.</p>
    <p>Knowledge alone does not make a professional. <span class="highlight-cherry-thin">High moral</span> is a vital part of every choice, without which value is not real. A professional futurist acts to 'improve the freedom and welfare of the humankind and of all the living beings, plants and the Earth's biosphere.' (W.Bell)</p>
    <p>Finally, <span class="highlight-cherry-thin">beauty of solutions</span> is important for me. Like in mathematics, the best solutions in life are often also the most beautiful ones. And again, like in mathematics, one needs fantasy even more than logic to conceive them. I agree with B. Lotto who put it simply: <span class="highlight-italic">'Creativity is another form of logic'</span>. It must be trained and developed.</p>

    <h3>What is futures research? And what is foresight?</h3>
    <p class="first-par"><span class="highlight-cherry-thin">Futures research</span> is holistic, systematic, multidisciplinary and critical exploration of future development alternatives. (S. Heinonen)</p>
    <p>Some people are more familiar with foresight, which is narrower than futures research. Foresight is a structured participatory debate about futures of complex issues. (S. Heinonen) It is generally intuitive, experimental and disruptive, and aims to go beyond what pure logical thinking can inform. (H. Mintzberg) It helps learn the interests of 'others', organize the discussion and decision-making process so as to reach effective and long-lasting results.</p>

    <h3>How can we learn about (possible, plausible, preferable) futures?</h3>
    <p class="first-par">Methods and tools vary in their purpose and suitability for different problems. Here is what a futurist's toolbox may look like:</p>
    <img src="methods.png" alt="Methods of futures research" class="non-wrapped-image">
    <p>One method is seldom enough. Usually, a combination of three or more methods is needed, particularly because the results obtained with one method need to be complemented or tested by other methods.</p>
    <p>Knowledge about possible, plausible and preferable futures helps take better decisions now. But is there any reliable way to know the future? The answer is yes and no. Knowledge about futures can be as reliable or unreliable as knowledge in any other field or about any other subject. Quality of knowledge depends both on the tools and on the hands that hold the tools. For great results, science and art shall go together.</p>
    <p>As an example of how foresight can help in extremely high uncertainty, here are a few slides from my presentation about far-far futures (sometimes called grand futures).</p>

    <h3>How can we benefit from the knowledge about future?</h3>
    <ul class="rose-list">
        <li>Be prepared:</li>
            <ul class="second-level-list">
                <li>Develop <span class="highlight-italic">skills</span> and capabilities: futures consciousness, futures literacy, and futures thinking skill.</li>
                <li>Get <span class="highlight-italic">information</span>: use scanning and analysis tools, systematically develop and interpret knowledge about future.</li>
                <li>Organize <span class="highlight-italic">foresight</span> activities and be better prepared as a team, organization or community.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Act wisely:</li>
            <ul class="second-level-list">
                <li>Knowledge about future can be used to <span class="highlight-italic">attack</span> (seize new opportunities), <span class="highlight-italic">defend</span> (avoid risks), and <span class="highlight-italic">create</span> (desirable futures: image + path + test). Relevant activities include, for instance, visioning and strategizing, technology foresight, business / service / product (re)design, etc.</li>
                <li>In addition, many lateral effects can be achieved like <span class="highlight-italic">improved learning capability</span> (learning from inside and outside of the organization), <span class="highlight-italic">mental shift</span> in the culture towards future-oriented thinking, increased <span class="highlight-italic">resilience</span> and <span class="highlight-italic">risk anticipation</span> capacity, stronger <span class="highlight-italic">unity around long-term goals</span>. Some typical failures become less common, e.g. partiality and sub-optimal framing, narrow views, too strong reliance on experts, wrong timing, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Help others:</li>
            <ul class="second-level-list">
                <li>Communicate from the futures perspective, unveil the whole picture, lead by example.</li>
            </ul>
